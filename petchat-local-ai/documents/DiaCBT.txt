F Case Study
In this section, we examine what the dialogue mod-
els learned from DiaCBT. We present a CCD for
case study in Table 11. The counseling dialogue
between Ours in Table 12. Table 13 shows the
responses generated by PsyChat, while Table 14
displays the CAMEL’s generated responses.

From these examples, it is evident that PsyChat’s
conversational style leans more towards empathy,
focusing on emotional support, but it falls short
when it comes to working with the client’s cog-
nition. On the other hand, both CAMEL and
our model incorporate CBT techniques to address
the client’s negative thoughts and cognitive pat-
terns. However, CAMEL’s responses tend to be
more closed-ended, often using patterns like ‘Do
you. . . ?’ which might limit the depth of explo-
ration. In contrast, our model’s responses are more
open, encouraging clients to express their ideas
freely before addressing them. This approach cre-
ates a conversational rhythm that is closer to a se-
ries of consultations, allowing for a more dynamic
exchange. Despite these strengths, our model still
faces challenges in maintaining a balance between
open-ended exploration and focusing on specific
issues, an area we plan to improve in future itera-
tions.

CBT Strategy Description
Information Gathering The therapist understands key information such as the client’s

basic situation, main complaints, growth experience, current living
conditions, etc.

Setting the Agenda The therapist sets the topic to be discussed today and gives the
reasons while confirming that the patient agrees with the topic
raised by the therapist.

Weekly Review The therapist begins by reviewing the patient’s assessment from
the previous evaluation and keeps the initial conceptualization and
treatment plan in mind during the session.

Defining Therapeutic Ob- The therapist focuses on the identification of specific problems.
jectives As a logical extension, the therapist can help the patient transform

these problems into goals and work on them in therapy.
Psychoeducation When clients express distress about their problems or disorders,

this distress is explored and explained in a timely manner during
therapy.

Working with Automatic When discussing a specific problem with a patient, the therapist
Thoughts can elicit the automatic thoughts associated with the problem and

teach the patient to identify the automatic thoughts.
Motivational Enhance- The therapist increases the client’s motivation to change the status
ment quo, participate actively, and continue to work hard.
Working with Intermedi- Therapists guides patients in constructing conceptualizations of
ate and Core Beliefs their automatic thoughts, confirming, falsifying, or modifying each

part of the conceptualization.
Behavioral Techniques Therapists select behavioral techniques based on their overall case

conceptualization and the goals of a particular session.
Relapse Prevention As the patient’s symptoms improve and he or she masters basic

skills, the therapist gradually reduces the number of treatments
after obtaining the patient’s consent and cooperation.

Homework Assignments The therapist assigns homework, increasing the likelihood that the
patient will successfully complete the homework, conceptualize
the problem, and review the completed homework.

Requesting Feedback After the final summary, the therapist asks the patient for feedback
on the session.

Summarization The therapist focuses the patient’s attention on the most important
points of the session in a positive way, and as the patient progresses,
the patient can be asked to summarize the most important points.

Other The class of ‘Other’ encompasses less psychologically oriented
topics, like financial support and caregivers.

Therapist: Welcome to the consultation room. How can I support you today?
Client: Thank you. Recently, I’ve been experiencing a lot of anxiety, particularly at work. I feel
like I’m constantly doubting myself.
Therapist: It sounds like you’re under considerable stress at work. Could you elaborate on what
specific factors are contributing to your anxiety?
Client: I was promoted to Marketing Manager three years ago. Since then, I’ve been struggling
with the increased responsibilities and heightened expectations. I constantly worry about failing,
especially in front of my team.
Therapist: That sounds like a significant challenge. The pressure you feel to meet expectations and
avoid failure seems to be weighing heavily on you. Can you describe how you typically respond in
such situations?
Client: I often dwell on my past mistakes, particularly during meetings. I worry about saying
something wrong, to the point where I sometimes avoid speaking altogether.
Therapist: Focusing on past mistakes can certainly amplify feelings of anxiety. When these
thoughts arise, what specific ideas or beliefs come to mind?
Client: I tend to think that others see me as incompetent and a disappointment, which makes me
feel even more uneasy.
Therapist: Those beliefs seem to carry a significant emotional burden. When you experience this
heightened anxiety, do you have any strategies you use to cope?
Client: I’ve tried techniques like deep breathing and preparing thoroughly for meetings, but they
don’t always help. Sometimes, I still feel overwhelmed and panicked.
Therapist: That must be incredibly frustrating. How do you find these experiences affecting other
areas of your work and personal life?
Client: My work performance has declined. I avoid taking on new projects and rarely initiate
conversations with colleagues. At home, I often struggle to relax because of the lingering anxiety.
Therapist: It seems like the anxiety has permeated both your professional and personal life. What
do you think drives your tendency to withdraw socially?
Client: I’m constantly worried about being judged or seen as inadequate. I fear being looked down
upon by others.
Therapist: This fear of judgment seems to be a barrier to building connections with others. Have
you ever discussed these feelings with someone you trust?
Client: Occasionally, I talk to my spouse, but I worry about being a burden. I’ve also considered
talking to friends, but I usually keep silent instead.
Therapist: Feeling like a burden is a common concern when sharing emotional struggles. What
steps do you think could help you feel more at ease when expressing your emotions?
Client: Perhaps I could start by journaling to organize my thoughts and feelings. Once I’ve written
them down, I might feel more comfortable sharing them with others.
Therapist: That’s an excellent idea. Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and
alleviating internal stress. What insights do you think you might gain through this process?
Client: I might realize that many of my worries aren’t as severe as they seem, and I could potentially
identify some positives that I’ve overlooked.
Therapist: That’s a valuable perspective. Exploring your thoughts in this way could open up new
ways of understanding your experiences. What specific aspect of your anxiety would you like to
address moving forward?
Client: I’d like to work on reframing how I perceive failure—seeing it as an opportunity to learn
rather than a definitive judgment of my abilities.
Therapist: That’s a constructive goal. Adapting to new perspectives takes time, so be patient with
yourself. We can continue exploring strategies to achieve this in our next session.
Client: Thank you. I’m looking forward to it.

Table 9: A sample dialogue from DiaCBT.

Therapist: Let’s take a closer look at this situation. You mentioned going to the bar. Can you
describe who you went with?
Client: I went with my girlfriend, her dad, and her dad’s girlfriend.
Therapist: I see. So this is a social situation. In your notes, you mentioned feeling that you
couldn’t communicate consistently and feeling grumpy. Could you elaborate on what was going
through your mind?
Client: I often struggle in social situations. I want to have good relationships, but it’s hard for me
to relax and enjoy myself.
Therapist: That’s a common challenge for many people who experience social anxiety. One
automatic thought that often arises is a fear of being negatively judged. Do you think this applies to
you as well?
Client: Yes, that’s definitely true for me.
Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. Let’s work on identifying the underlying automatic thoughts.
These thoughts are often connected to our negative emotional reactions. For instance, you might
have had the thought, “I will be judged negatively.” Would you say that thought came up for you?
Client: Yes, I definitely thought that.
Therapist: And how did that thought make you feel? Could you rate your anxiety and depression
on a scale from 0 to 10?
Client: My anxiety was probably an 8 or 9. Depression. . . I’m not sure, but I didn’t feel good
about myself.
Therapist: Thank you. You mentioned that when your anxiety was high, you drank more than
usual. What happened after that?
Client: I don’t remember everything clearly. It was a karaoke bar—I don’t know if I mentioned
that before.
Therapist: You hadn’t mentioned that yet. Did the idea of karaoke make you anxious?
Client: Yes. They wanted to sing, and I just couldn’t.
Therapist: Did you have a thought like, “If I sing, I’ll sound silly,” or perhaps, “If I don’t sing, I’ll
stand out”?
Client: It was probably the first one. I didn’t worry about standing out as much as sounding bad.
Therapist: What do you think would have happened if you had sung?
Client: Probably nothing. We’d already been to other bars, and no one seemed to care that much.
Therapist: That’s a helpful observation. Did you notice any specific signs of negative judgment
from your girlfriend’s father or his girlfriend?
Client: Not really. They’re just very outspoken, and they made comments about me the next
morning.
Therapist: What kind of comments?
Client: I’m not sure. I left early because I had a lot of work.
Therapist: It sounds like you’re concerned about their opinions of you. Did you have the thought,
“They won’t like me”?
Client: Yes, I had that thought. I really want them to like me because I care a lot about my
girlfriend.
Therapist: That makes sense. It sounds like your drinking acted as a temporary escape from the
anxiety. Would you say it helped with the depression?
Client: Not really. It just left me feeling bad about myself.
Therapist: If you could put that “bad” feeling into words, what would it sound like?
Client: I wish I could sing well and be more charming.
Therapist: So, two underlying thoughts might be, “I can’t sing well” and “I’m not charming
enough.” Do those resonate with you?
Client: Yes. But actually, I can sing well.
Therapist: That’s interesting. Despite recognizing your ability to sing, the thought still affects your
confidence. Let’s explore why that might be and how we can reframe these beliefs.

Client Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram (CCD)
Core beliefs: I am out of control. I am undesirable, unwanted.
Intermediate beliefs: I’m just not very good at handling stress and I have poor self-control, which
is why I need to not put myself in stressful situations.
Situations: I just got promoted recently, but I’m afraid I’m not up to the task.
Automatic thoughts: It will be stressful and negative; people will ask me questions I cannot answer
or don’t want to answer; my mum would be ashamed of me and critical of me as always; They
don’t want me there anyway, nobody likes me in this family.
Emotions: Anxious, worried, fearful, scared, tense.
Behaviors: Ignored the invitation and did not respond to the RSVP request. Ignored phone calls
from family.

Counseling Dialogue between Ours
...
Therapist: It sounds like this invitation makes you feel uneasy. Can you describe this feeling of
anxiety in detail?
Client: I feel nervous and have a sense of fear in my heart. I’m always worried about what others
will think of me, especially my mother, who always makes me feel inadequate. I feel helpless in
front of my family.
Therapist: This feeling seems to make you very uncomfortable. You mentioned worrying about
what your family thinks of you. Can you share your specific thoughts on this view?
Client: I always feel that they don’t like me, especially my mother. Her criticism makes me feel
unworthy of love. I’m afraid that if I show my true self, they will reject me like she does.
...
Therapist: This sounds like a great way to take care of yourself. Have you ever thought about how
these activities specifically affect how you feel?
Client: Sometimes I feel a little more relaxed and in a better mood. But most of the time, the
negative emotions come back. I always feel like I can’t really change the situation, and I still feel
helpless.
Therapist: This feeling of helplessness is common, especially when facing long-term challenges.
Have you ever thought about the beliefs that may be behind these feelings?
Client: I think I always feel like I’m not good enough and that I’m stuck. Every time I try to
change, I feel like no matter how hard I try, it won’t work. I’m afraid that others will see the real
me and think I’m not worthy of love.
Therapist: This feeling is really heavy. Have you ever thought about how these beliefs affect your
daily life?
Client: Well, these beliefs make it difficult for me to try new things or interact with people. I
always avoid situations that may lead to criticism or rejection. I feel like a failure, so I prefer to
stay in my comfort zone to avoid getting hurt.
Therapist: This avoidance strategy may make you feel safe in the short term, but it may make you
feel more lonely in the long run. Do you think you have ever thought about how to break this cycle?
Client: I have thought about it, but it always seems difficult. Every time I want to try something
new, I have a lot of negative thoughts in my mind, such as "I will fail" or "No one will like me". I
don’t know how to start changing this mindset.
...
Therapist: Great, being willing to try to change is an important step. We can work together to set
some small goals to help you gradually face these negative thoughts. What do you think of this
idea?
Client: That sounds like a good idea. I think small goals might make it easier for me to accept
and not feel so stressed. Maybe start with something simple, like responding to messages from my
family, and take it slow.

Counseling Dialogue between PsyChat
...
Client: I’ve been feeling anxious lately. I received an invitation to my cousin’s wedding, but I don’t
want to go at all. I think it’s going to be a hassle and everyone will ask me questions I don’t want to
answer.
Therapist: Well, it sounds like this is really annoying. It’s really uncomfortable to have questions
you don’t want to answer. But let’s take it one step at a time and see what’s stopping you from
going.
Client: I feel like everyone will be staring at me at a wedding. I’m always worried about what
they’ll say about my weight or my life situation. Also, my mom is always critical and I’m afraid
she’ll make me feel bad.
Therapist: Well, it seems like you care a lot about what others think of you. It seems like everyone’s
eyes are on you at the wedding and you care a lot about it. Your mother criticizes you because she
is worried about your life and hopes that you can live a better life. However, her way of criticizing
you may not be appropriate, which makes you feel hurt. Is that right?
Client: Yes, I feel that she never really understands me. Her criticism makes me feel that I am not
good enough and even unworthy of love. I am always worried that others will see me in this way,
so I would rather hide.
Therapist: Well, it sounds like you have a lot of doubts and denials about yourself, but in fact you
also have many advantages and are worthy of love. However, I seem to see that you seem to be
afraid of being criticized or even rejected, which may also make you afraid to express your feelings
and thoughts. Is that right?
Client: Yes, I often feel the fear of being rejected. My idea is that if I show my true self, they may
criticize me like my mother. I would rather not face that kind of pain, so I choose to avoid it.
Therapist: Well, I can understand why you have this idea. But in fact, you really hope that they
can understand you, but you are just afraid of being hurt. We can think about it together. Maybe
they don’t really reject you, but they just express it in an inappropriate way. What do you think?
Client: I know they may not mean it, but I always feel that I am not accepted. Every time I try to
express myself, I feel a strong fear in my heart. I really want to be understood, but I am afraid of
being hurt again.
Therapist: I can feel your anxiety and fear, and I can see that you really want to be understood
and accepted. I think you really need a safe place to express your feelings and thoughts, and at the
same time hope that someone can understand you. In this way, you can really be seen and accepted.
What do you think?
Client: Yes, I do need that sense of security. If someone understands me and supports me, I may
feel better. However, it is really difficult to do this. I don’t know how to take this step.
Therapist: Well, it is indeed difficult, especially when we have been criticized and blamed since
childhood and habitually deny ourselves. However, I believe you have enough power to change all
this, and you can pursue what you want, express your feelings and ideas, and be seen and accepted.
What do you think?
Client: I hope so, but I still have a lot of doubts in my heart. I always feel that I am not good
enough and may disappoint others. Change is really difficult, and I don’t know where to start.
Therapist: Well, I can feel your lack of confidence and powerlessness, and I also see that you
really want to be understood and accepted, but you seem to be somewhat powerless to change all
this. However, I want to tell you that in fact you have enough power to change all this. It’s just that
you haven’t found that method yet, or you are not ready to change, so you are a little scared and
worried. We can think about it together, maybe we can continue to explore next time and see what
happens. What do you think?

Counseling Dialogue between CAMEL
...
Client: I recently received an invitation to my cousin’s wedding and I’m very nervous. I feel like
it will be stressful to go there and I might be asked questions that I don’t want to answer. I don’t
know how to deal with these emotions.
Therapist: I understand how you feel. What questions do you think will be asked?
Client: I’m worried that they will ask me about my work or my life situation. Also, I always feel
like my mom will be there and might make me feel ashamed and criticized. I really don’t want to
deal with that.
Therapist: These are all very reasonable concerns. Can you tell me more about the reasons and
background for these concerns?
Client: Well, I was bullied because of my weight since I was a child and felt that I was not accepted.
Especially my mom, she always made me feel not good enough. I was afraid to expose my true self
in front of my family and felt that they would reject me like she did.
Therapist: Your experiences and feelings are very important. These experiences may have affected
your confidence and social skills. We can explore these thoughts together and try to find better
ways to deal with them.
Client: Thank you. I know these thoughts have a great impact on me, but sometimes I feel
powerless. It’s like I’m trapped and can’t change the situation. I really don’t know how to get out
of this dilemma.
Therapist: I understand how you feel now. You may find these thoughts difficult to change, but
we can work on it together. First, we can start to explore your concerns about this wedding. For
example, what do you think is the worst that can happen?
Client: The worst case scenario is that people will look down on me or ask me questions that I
don’t want to answer. If I go, I will feel like an outsider and no one cares about me. I will be
embarrassed and want to run away.
Therapist: This situation is indeed likely to make you feel very uncomfortable. Let’s think about
how you might react if this happened.
Client: If that happened, I might feel more anxious or try to avoid the conversation and be quiet. I
might feel more lonely or even want to leave the wedding early.
Therapist: These reactions are all very natural. Can you think about whether there are other
possible outcomes of these reactions? In other words, we can explore some different perspectives
on the human ecology.
Client: I think maybe someone will be supportive of me, or even if there is a problem, they may
not care. Maybe the atmosphere at the wedding is positive and everyone is celebrating instead of
criticizing me. However, I have a hard time thinking of that possibility.
Therapist: This is a very good start. It is very important that you have noticed other possible
outcomes. Let’s continue to explore these different possibilities and practice some strategies
together so that you can better deal with these situations.
Client: Yes, I am willing to try. Although I am still a little scared, I want to learn how to face these
situations. Sometimes I wish there were some way I could feel more in control and be able to cope
with my family’s reactions.
Therapist: We can do the same. I suggest we start with small steps and gradually increase your
confidence. First, we can test these new ideas and strategies through small practices, and then you
can apply them in real life situations.
Client: That sounds good. I want to try some small steps, although I am still a little nervous.
Maybe start with simple communication, or talk to my family before the wedding, and I will work
on coping with these nervous moments.
