INSTRUCTIONS
 
This book is intended as a practical guide for clinicians who wish to use Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy for Depression (CBT-D) with Veterans.  It can be used as an additional resource 
to  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression in Veterans and Military Servicemembers: 
Therapy Manual (Wenzel, A., Brown, G. K., & Karlin, B. E., 2011).  This resource was created to use 
in order of typical therapy.  The first section (pages 6-31) correlates to the Initial Phase of CBT, 
the second section (pages 32-99) correlates to the Middle Phase of CBT, and the last section 
(94-107) correlates to the Later Phase of CBT. 

The Initial Phase includes a preliminary assessment and case conceptualization tool to assist the 
clinician with targeting problem areas and identifying evidence-based interventions aimed at 
reducing depression symptoms.  The Initial Phase helps Veterans gain an understanding of the 
structure and process of CBT and is used to generate treatment goals.  During the Middle Phase 
of therapy, the provider and Veteran work together to address treatment goals.  The provider 
should select the most appropriate behavioral and cognitive techniques according to the case 
conceptualization.  The central focus of this resource is on the actual course of therapy.  As 
you review the interventions, we recommend that you consider how each intervention may be 
individually applied. The Later Phase of treatment focuses on the Veteran’s progress toward 
reaching their treatment goals.  Specifically, evaluating whether they can apply techniques 
appropriately to help alleviate depressive symptoms.  The Later Phase also focuses on creating 
a relapse prevention plan.   

Suggestions for using the guide: 

• Select handouts you are most likely to use and provide the Veteran with their own 
copies.  

• Keep quantities of selected handouts in folders so they will be easy to offer the Veteran. 

• Handouts can reinforce and validate ideas you have presented in session.  They can 
serve as transitional objects for the Veteran as they prepare for discharge and relapse 
prevention planning.   

The contents of this manual do not represent the views of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the U.S. government. 
This manual was supported by a clinical educator grant from the VA South 
Central Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC).

WHAT IS COGNITIVE
  
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY?
 
(PSYCHOEDUCATION)
 

6 



WHAT TO EXPECT?
 

• 	 CBT is evidence based. CBT has been well tested in research studies and has been proven to 
be effective in treating depression. 

• 	 CBT is structured. You should expect to have a good idea of where you’re going and how 
to get there.  So, we will set clear goals to create a roadmap that will help us find the best 
way to improve your symptoms. During each session we will set an agenda for what we want 
to discuss, we will discuss last week’s practice assignment, discuss agenda items, and then 
assign new homework. 

•	  CBT is psychoeducational. The entire program is skill based and involves you enhancing 
your skill set.  You will learn different “tools” to help cope with your current problems that 
you will be able to take with you when treatment is over.   

•	  CBT is goal oriented. We will work together to identify and achieve specific treatment goals. 
We will track your progress on your goals and problem solve ways to reach them. 

•	  CBT is time limited. Treatment is usually 16-20 weeks. 

•	  CBT requires you to attend weekly sessions. Regular attendance is essential to recovery.  
Sessions are approximately 50 minutes long. 

•	  CBT requires active participation. What you get out of treatment is a direct result of the 
effort you put into it.  Just showing up is not enough.  We need you to be an active partner in 
your treatment process. 

•	  CBT has a home practice requirement. Treatment is challenging and takes daily 
commitment from you to be successful.  CBT is not a one time therapy.  It is not an instant 
change that you will immediately notice after one session.  Practice assignments help put 
your new skills to use.  

•	  CBT focuses on the here and now. Treatment emphasizes how depression is maintained in 
your present life.  

• 	 CBT is collaborative. Although the therapist is the expert on CBT, you are the expert on 
yourself.  We will work together to tailor your treatment to your needs.

WHAT IS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY?
 
Cognitive Therapy + Behavioral Therapy = Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 

Cognitive Model: 

• Cognitive refers to the act of knowing or recognizing our experiences.  

• The cognitive model focuses on thinking and how our thoughts are connected to our 
mood, physiological responses, and behaviors 

• Cognitive therapy will teach you to change your thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes that 
contribute to your depression.   

Two people can be faced with similar situations, but because they think about those situations 
in different ways, they have different reactions to them.

BEHAVIORAL MODEL
 

“Depressed individuals do not get enough positive reinforcement from interactions with their 
environment to maintain happy, adaptive behavior” (Wenzel, Brown, & Karlin, 2011).  

Two behavioral patterns associated with depression: 

Low level of positive feelings from engaging in life activities 
No longer participating in enjoyable activities 
Not getting as much enjoyment in activities as in the past 
No longer enjoying socializing with others 

High rate of negative consequences 
Frequently noticing things are not working out 
Feeling a lack of support and understanding from others

STEPS OF CBT
  
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy helps people become more aware of the relationship between 
their thoughts, feelings, and emotions. 

    Become aware of: 
  Step 1   Automatic thoughts 
    Feelings 
    Core beliefs 
    Behaviors 
    Physical reactions 
    Environment 

     Examination: 
  Step 2   Thoughts are not facts 
    Examine the evidence, look for proof 
    Question and challenge irrational beliefs 
    Don’t believe everything you think 

     Create alternative thoughts: 
  Step  3  Increase positive self talk 
    Reduce negative automatic thoughts 
    Replace irrational beliefs with more rational ones

CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION WORKSHEET EXAMPLE
 

Veteran Name: Robert Jones Date:  August 30, 2018 

Symptoms: Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Recurrent 
Veteran presents with depressed mood, anhedonia, low energy, a decrease in appetite, 
feelings of worthlessness, hypersomnia, decrease in socialization, psychomotor 
retardation, and non-suicidal self-directed violence ideation.  Convincingly denies 
preparatory behaviors, intent, or plan.   He has had these symptoms for the past year and 
they reoccur at least once a month, lasting for two weeks at a time.  When depressed he 
drinks more and isolates from family and friends.  He noted this has not helped decrease 
his depressive symptoms.  He noted playing his guitar and writing music helps decrease 
his symptoms. 

Formative Influences: Robert is a 21-year-old, Caucasian, cisgender, unmarried 
male that grew up in a small town in the Delta of Mississippi.  He is the oldest of 
4 (siblings aged 12, 15, 17). Mother and father are both deceased; they died in a 
car accident involving a drunk driver. Veteran was the first in his immediate family 
to graduate high school and he is the first to enlist in the military.  He is now 4 
credits away from graduating from college with a B.S. in Criminology.  Veteran 
described himself as a “popular guy” in his hometown, played many school sports, 
and was Homecoming King his senior year.  He enlisted in the Navy at 19 years old 
in the Submarine Electronics Computer Field (SECF) and worked with submarine 
communications systems.  Veteran was involved in war games, but never deployed 
or engaged in combat.  Veteran was stationed in Honolulu, HI when he received 
a Red Cross Emergency Notification that both of his parents were deceased.   
Veteran received a genuine dependency discharge, has moved back home, and is 
now the primary caregiver for his siblings.   

Biological, Genetic, and Medical Factors: Veteran believes his mother may have 
experienced postpartum depression after the birth of his youngest sibling, but denied any 
other family history.  No known contributing medical factors.  

Situational Issues/Interpersonal Issues: There are limited opportunities for employment 
in his hometown and he’s concerned that he will have to relocate his family further south 
to find a job that will support him and his siblings.  He is the primary caregiver of his 
siblings, no other family members within 50-mile radius.  Several of Veteran’s friends from 
high school still live in town; however, he rarely socializes with them and has very limited 
finances.  He has never attended therapy.  His depression makes it difficult for him to 
search for more opportunities.  If he wasn’t depressed he noted he would be more social, 
find a partner, and be able to feel better about providing for his family.  

24
 



Strengths/Barriers: Veteran is young, able-bodied, and reports a willingness to work.  He 
is seeking mental health support for the first time and reports a desire for change.  He is 
intelligent, computer savvy, and loving.

parents grave site. 

Core Beliefs: I am a failure. I am a bad son. People are better off without me. 

Hypothesis:  Since the death of his parents, Robert has experienced a number of significant 
changes to his life.  He has yet to grieve the loss of his parents or his identity as a service 
member and is struggling to accept the new reality of being the primary caregiver for his 
siblings. Veteran believes that his future possibilities are now significantly limited and he will 
be unable to live a fulfilling life.  

Veteran’s Goal:  “I want to deal with my parents’ deaths and be able to better care for my 
siblings.” 

Treatment Plan/Strategies: 
(1) Behavioral skills to establish behavioral patterns, encourage participation in pleasant 
activities, recognize those activities that give a sense of accomplishment or fulfillment, and 
determine new goals. 
(2) Cognitive strategies to identify and modify problematic cognitions (negative automatic 
thoughts, working with core beliefs, and developing problem-solving skills).

GOAL SETTING
 

27 



SMART GOALS 
Setting goals assists in developing a pathway to making changes.  Goals should be specific, 
measurable, achievable, realistic, and time limited. 

Specific Identifies a specific action or event that will take place 
Who? What? When? Where? How? 

Measurable Should be quantifiable so progress can be tracked 

Achievable Should be attainable and realistic given resources 

Realistic Should be personally meaningful and really matter 

Timely State the time period for accomplishing the goal 
                                                                                                                                        Adapted from Doran, 1981

BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION 
• 	 The goal of behavioral activation is to gradually assist you in decreasing your 

movement toward isolation and avoidance and to help you become more active and 
engage in activities that are known to improve mood.  

•	  Often, these are activities that you enjoyed before you became depressed.  

• 	 The activities vary from person to person and may include very simple activities, 
such as engaging in personal hygiene, showering, doing household chores, engaging 
in forms of exercise, taking classes, going out to dinner, or anything that you find 
personally rewarding. 

• 	 As you know, however, getting yourself to feel better is not an easy thing to do. Talking 
yourself into feeling better or trying to convince yourself to feel better unfortunately 
doesn’t work. 

• 	 Your thoughts and feelings are affected by your interactions with others and your 
overall quality of life. So, for you to have more positive thoughts and to feel better, you 
must first become more active and put yourself into more positive situations.  

• 	 This will probably be somewhat challenging when you first start.  It will become 
easier as more and more positive experiences occur. This strategy requires hard 
work, and I understand that you may be questioning your ability to make changes 
at this time in your life, but I will help you through this process and we will work at a 
gradual pace together.

GRADED TASK ASSIGNMENTS
 
This is a technique for turning overwhelming tasks into manageable achievements, in other 
words, breaking down a task step by step. This involves breaking a big goal into smaller goals 
that are then put in the most logical, achievable order. 

1.	  Choose an activity or goal to break down. 
a.	  Look at all the activities you have scheduled for next week. Is there one that seems a 

bit too big? If not, think of a goal you would like to accomplish over the next month 
and practice on that. 

2. Break it down into smaller steps. 
a.	  For example, if you scheduled in ‘go to the gym’ you could break that down to pack 

my gym bag, buy a bottle of water, find my membership card, etc. 

3. Put the steps you’ve come up with into the most logical order. 
a.	  There may not be a point in packing your gym bag if you’ve lost your 
 

membership card.
 

3. Schedule your first step. 
a.	  If you chose an activity from your schedule, perhaps reschedule the various steps 

now so that you are definitely going to get the activity done. If you are working with 
a general goal, pick one task to get started on and either do it now if you have time 
or schedule it into your week. 

b. Match the task you choose to your present energy levels. Do not assume you can 
accomplish what you might have previously during a time when life was not as 
challenging. It’s better to choose a task that is too easy but you will accomplish than 
something you won’t.

RELAXATION: BENEFITS & TIPS
 
The goal of relaxation is to reduce the effects of stress on your health. Since chronic pain 
produces chronic stress on the body, it is important to regularly practice relaxation techniques 
that can help your mind and body recover. Relaxation is more than resting or enjoying a hobby – 
it involves using specific strategies to reduce tension. 
 
Benefits of Relaxation 
Relaxation is important for good health. When you are relaxed, your muscles are loose, your 
heart rate is normal, and your breathing is slow and deep. Learning how to relax can help 
especially when you feel pain. Relaxation prompts your body to release chemicals that reduce 
pain and produce a sense of well-being. 

Relaxation won’t cure pain or other chronic symptoms, but skills that relax the body and the 
mind may help decrease muscle tension, prevent muscle spasms, and relieve the stress that can 
aggravate pain and other symptoms. 

Taking time to relax and refuel your energy provides benefits such as: 

• Improved mood 

• Increased energy and productivity 

• Improved concentration and focus 

• Improved sense of control over stress and daily demands 

• Improved nighttime sleep 

• Increased self-confidence 

• Greater ability to handle problems 

• Decreased anxiety and other negative emotions such as anger and frustration 

• Increased blood flow to muscles and reduced muscle tension 

• Lower blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate 

• Decreased pain, such as headaches and back pain 

Relaxation Practice Tips 
Relaxation is a skill that requires practice. You may not feel the benefits immediately, so don’t 
give up! Remain patient and motivated and you’ll reduce the negative impacts of stress. And 
remember: If relaxation feels foreign or unnatural, that likely means you are a person who needs 
it most!

Establish a routine 
• Set aside time to practice relaxation at least once or twice a day. 

• Pairing relaxation with a regular activity may help you remember to practice (for example, 
take 10 relaxed breaths before bed or whenever you sit down to eat). 

• Practice at various times throughout the day until relaxation becomes natural and you can 
use it readily when you feel stressed. You may want to leave “reminders” for yourself to 
relax (for example, sticky notes on the bathroom mirror, kitchen cabinets, or car dashboard 
with the words “relax” or “breathe”). 

Be comfortable 
• Practice on a comfortable chair, sofa, mat, or bed. 

• Dim the lights. 

• Loosen tight clothing and remove shoes, belt, glasses or contact lenses, if you like. 

Concentrate 
• Eliminate disruptions. Turn off the TV, radio, or telephone. Practice in a quiet, calm,
  

environment.
 

• Close your eyes to reduce distractions and improve concentration. If you prefer, keep your 
eyes open and focus on one spot. 

• Move your body as little as possible, changing positions only for comfort. 

• Don’t worry if you have some distracting thoughts—it happens to everyone. Just notice 
that your thoughts have wandered and then gently, without judgment, return your 
attention to your breath.

49
 



Relax 
• Begin and end relaxation practices with relaxed breathing techniques. 

• Use a relaxation CD if it helps. Gradually, learn to relax without a CD so that you can use 
relaxation techniques anywhere. 

• Let relaxation proceed naturally and spread throughout your body. Do not try to resist it. 

Be patient 
• Give yourself time to learn relaxation skills. Practice is required for these techniques to 

become automatic. 

• Try not to become upset if you have trouble concentrating. A wandering mind is normal 
and expected. Keep bringing your attention back to your breath. 

• Don’t worry about how well you are practicing. 

• After a few weeks, select a word, such as “calm,” “relax,” “peace,” or “patience” that you 
can say during relaxation practices. Eventually, simply saying that word may help you relax. 

Incorporate relaxation into daily life 
• Over time, move relaxation practices from planned, quiet settings to “real life.” The goal is 

to be able to calm yourself when necessary, no matter where you are. 

• Use relaxation whenever you notice yourself feeling stressed or anxious, such as waiting in 
line, at a doctor’s appointment, or during a difficult meeting.

DEEP BREATHING
  
First, start by becoming aware of your breathing...  Place one hand on your abdomen at the 
waistline and the other hand on the center of your chest. Without trying to change anything, 
simply notice how you are breathing. Notice where you are breathing from…  whether your 
shoulders are rising and falling, whether your chest is rising and falling, or perhaps your belly is 
rising and falling. Notice how your hands move as you breathe…  (PAUSE) 

Now notice the rate of your breathing. Are you breathing rapidly or slowly? Are you breathing 
deeply or more shallowly (PAUSE) 

Now as you slowly inhale, imagine the air flowing deeper into your belly. Feel your belly fill with 
air as your lower hand rises. Pause at the top of your breath, and then follow your breath out as 
you completely exhale…  Slowly take a breath in...  2, 3, 4... and slowly exhale…2, 3, 4. Let any 
tension melt away as you relax more deeply with each breath...  (PAUSE) 

Notice how the air feels, as cool fresh air enters your nose, passes through the little hairs in your 
nasal passage, reaches the back of your throat, and descends deep into your lungs. Notice what 
happens as that breath of fresh air enters your lungs. Notice what happens when you exhale. 
Feel the temperature of each breath, cool as you inhale, and warm as you exhale. Count your 
breaths as you breathe in and out. 

Notice your breath becoming smooth and slow. Feel your belly and ribcage expand outward 
with each breath...  and feel yourself become more relaxed with each exhale. Allow your 
shoulders to become heavier with each exhale…  (PAUSE 15 sec) 

Continue breathing slowly and gently...  (PAUSE 15 sec) 

As you breathe, notice the cool temperature of the air, as it enters your nose or mouth. Notice 
how the air becomes warmer as you follow it deep into your belly and out through your mouth. 

Continue breathing slowly and gently...  (PAUSE 15 sec) 

Again, slowly take a breath in...  2, 3, 4... and slowly exhale…  2, 3, 4. Feel yourself become more 
and more relaxed with each exhale…  (PAUSE 15 sec) 

(Skip if going on to other relaxation exercises) 

Now, as I count from 5 to 1, feel yourself become more alert…   5 bringing your attention to this 
room…  4 feeling calm and relaxed…  3 start to wiggle your fingers and toes…  2 slowly start to 
move and stretch your muscles…  1 open your eyes, feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.

PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION
 
First, build up the tension in the lower arms, by making fists with your hands and pulling your 
fists up by bending the wrists. Feel the tension through the lower arms, wrists, fingers, knuckles, 
and hands. Focus on the tension…  (PAUSE 5 sec) 

Now release the tension. Let your hands and lower arms relax onto the chair or bed beside you. 
Focus your attention on the relaxing sensations in your hands and arms. Feel the release from 
tension as you relax the muscles fully, feel it get warm…  (PAUSE 10 sec) 

Now build up the tension in the upper arms by pulling the arms back and in toward your sides. 
Feel the tension in the back of the arms and radiating towards the shoulders and into the back. 
Focus on the tension. Hold this tension…  (PAUSE 5 sec) 

Now, release the arms and let them relax – almost feeling heavy at your sides. Notice the 
difference between the prior feelings of tension and the new feelings of relaxation. Your arms 
might feel heavy, warm, and relaxed…  (PAUSE 10 sec) 

Now bring your attention to your lower legs. Build up the tension by flexing your feet and pulling 
your toes toward your upper body. Feel the tension as it spreads through your feet, ankles, shins, 
and calves. Hold this tension…  (PAUSE 5 sec) 

And release all of the tension in your lower legs. Let your legs relax onto the chair or bed. Feel 
the difference in these muscles as they relax. Feel the release from tension, the sense of comfort, 
the heaviness of relaxation...  (PAUSE 10 sec) 

Build up the tension in your upper legs and buttocks by pressing your knees together and lifting 
the legs slightly off of the bed or chair. Focus on the tightness through the front of your thighs 
and buttocks. Hold this tension…  (PAUSE 5 sec) 

Now release all of the tension in your upper legs. Let your legs sink heavily into the chair or bed. 
Let all of the tension disappear as your legs sink heavier into the chair or bed. Focus on the 
feeling of relaxation and comfort… (PAUSE 10 sec) 

Build up the tension in your abdomen by pulling your abdomen in toward your spine, very 
tightly. Feel the tightness and focus on this tension…  (PAUSE 5 sec) 

Now let the tension in the abdomen relax…  Notice how smooth and calm your breathing has 
become. Feel the comfort of relaxation…  (PAUSE 10 sec)

53
 



Build up the tension in your chest by taking in a deep breath and holding it. Your chest is 
expanded and the muscles are stretched around your chest. Feel the tension in your front and 
your back...  (PAUSE 3-5 sec) 

Now, slowly let the air escape and resume normal breathing, letting the air flow in and out 
smoothly and easily. Feel the difference in sensations as the muscles relax, compared to those of 
tension…  (PAUSE 10 sec) 

Build up the tension in your neck and shoulders by pulling your shoulder blades back and up 
towards your ears. Feel the tension around your shoulders, radiating into your neck and back. 
Hold this tension…  (PAUSE 5 sec) 

Now release the tension. Let your shoulders drop down, sinking further and further until they 
are completely relaxed. Notice the difference in the previous feelings of tension and the new 
feelings of relaxation. Enjoy these feelings…  (PAUSE 10 sec) 

Build up the tension in your mouth, jaw and throat by clenching your teeth and turning the 
corners of your mouth back into a forced smiled. Hold. Feel the tightness…   (PAUSE 5 sec) 

Now, release the tension. Let your jaw drop down and the muscles around your throat and 
jaw relax. Notice the difference between the feelings of tension and the feelings of relaxation… 
(PAUSE 10 sec) 

Now, build up the tension around your eyes and lower forehead, by squeezing your eyes tightly 
shut and pulling your eyebrows down… hold this tension (PAUSE 5 sec) 

Now release all the tension in your eyes and lower forehead. Let the tension disappear from 
around your eyes. Feel your forehead and eyes smooth. Feel the difference as the muscles 
relax…   (PAUSE 10 sec) 

Build up the tension in your upper forehead and scalp by raising your eyebrows as high as 
possible. Feel the wrinkling and pulling across the forehead and top of the head. Hold this 
tension…  (PAUSE 5 sec) 

Now release all the tension in your forehead, letting the eyebrows gently rest down. Focus on 
the sensations of relaxation…  (PAUSE 10 sec) 

Your whole body is feeling relaxed and calm. Scan your body for any last bits of tension and if 
you notice any, let that tension go. Enjoy the feelings of relaxation…

As I count from 1 to 5, feel yourself become more and more relaxed…  1 … let all tension leave
  
your body…  2 … sinking further and further into relaxation…  3 … feel more and more relaxed…  4
  
… feel very relaxed…  5 …deeply relaxed…  (PAUSE 30 sec)
 

As you spend a few minutes in this relaxed state, think about your breathing. Feel the cool air as
  
you breathe in and the warm air as you breathe out. Your breathing is smooth and regular. Every
  
time you breathe out, think to yourself “relax…  relax …  relax”…  you are feeling comfortable and
  
relaxed…  (PAUSE 1-3 min)
 

(Skip if going on to other relaxation exercises)
 
Now, as I count from 5 to 1, feel yourself become more alert…   5 bringing your attention to this
  
room…  4 feeling calm and relaxed…  3 start to wiggle your fingers and toes…  2 slowly start to

or outside. The path is comforting and peaceful. As you walk down this path, imagine all of your 
stresses, worries, and tension are leaving you. Enjoy this journey to your special place. 
As you walk down this path, notice the ground beneath you…how it feels as you walk. Notice the 
sounds…the comfortable temperature of the air. Take a breath in, feeling all your tension leave 
you as you exhale. Notice any fragrance that may be here. Notice the view around you. Reach 
out and touch something around you. Feel its textures… 

You feel calm and safe. All your worries and anxieties being left behind as you move toward your 
special place…  (PAUSE 30 sec) 

Walk down this path until you arrive at your own special place…and when you have reached this 
special place, go ahead and enter… (PAUSE 10 sec) 

You have arrived at this relaxing and peaceful place. Notice the ground underneath you… 
whether it is hard or soft. Notice how the ground feels below your feet. Listen to the sounds in 
this place, both close and distant. Smell the air, the fragrances. Notice the temperature of the air 
around you. 

Look above you…  Notice the colors and sights above you. Look out into the distance…  as far as 
you can see…  Take in all of the sights, fragrances, and sounds around you. 
Reach out and touch something in this place…  Notice its texture and how it feels against your 
skin. Notice the different objects around you…  their shapes, textures, and colors. Notice the light 
and shade of this place and how it reflects off of these objects.

There is a comfortable place for you to sit or lie here as you take in all the smells, sounds, sights, 
and textures…  As you sit or lie in this place, away from it all, you feel calm and secure, refreshed 
and renewed, strong and at peace. As you enjoy this place for a few minutes, you know that you 
can come here whenever you please, and that this place will always be waiting for you…  (PAUSE 
3-5 min) 

Now it’s time to come back…  leave by the same way you came, enjoying the path…  and as you 
return on this path, you start to also notice the room in which you are sitting…  start to wiggle 
your fingers and toes…  and when you are ready, slowly open your eyes and stretch.

SCHEDULE WORRY TIME
 

• There is a drastic difference between “thinking” versus “worrying.” 

° Thinking involves reflection and analysis that leads to clarity and purposeful action.  

° Worrying is problem-solving gone awry.  

° Many chronic worriers tend to believe they can’t control their thoughts. 

With practice, you can learn to control how often and when you worry.  When you give in to 
unproductive worry throughout the day, the pull to worry repetitively will only grow stronger.  

Alternatively, if you limit the amount of time and energy you spend on worrying, the intensity 
and frequency of this unhealthy habit will start to diminish over time.  

Step 1.  Schedule worry time each day for one week.  Set aside 15-30 minutes during the 
morning or afternoon (avoid scheduling worry time in the evening or before bed). 

Step 2.  During the 15-30 minutes write down all your worries.  Do not start to problem solve 
yet!  Do not fight or struggle with your thoughts.  Just write them down as they come to 
mind. 

Step 3.  In between scheduled worry time, if you notice that your mind is being pulled to worry, 
remind yourself that you will have time to worry again and give yourself permission to let 
go of those thoughts for now. 

Step 4.  At the end of the week, look over the list of worries you wrote down. Do you notice any 
patterns? Changes in the content of your worries?  Reflect on what you have learned 
from this list. 

Ideally, you may start to notice that it is difficult to worry for the entire time you have set aside 
every day.  This strategy may seem a bit strange at first.  Give it your best and keep an open 
mind.

AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS 
Automatic thoughts can be words, an image, a memory, a physical sensation, an imagined 

sound, or based on intuition. It is a surface-level, nonvolitional, stream-of-consciousness, 

meaning they just happen, popping into your head; often you won’t even notice them.  

We tend to automatically believe our thoughts whether they are positive or negative.  

Automatic thoughts seem to repeat over and over, and the more they repeat, the more 

believable they seem.
 

As the name indicates, these automatic thoughts cannot be directly controlled by people,
  
since they are reflexive reactions based on the beliefs people hold about themselves.  However,
  
people can indirectly control these thoughts by challenging the beliefs that lead to them.
 

Examples:
 
“Nothing feels good anymore.”
  
“I can’t stand this anymore.”
  
“I can’t get started.”
  
“What’s wrong with me?”
  
“I wish I were somewhere else.”
 

INTERMEDIATE BELIEFS 
Intermediate beliefs are just below the surface
  
of automatic thoughts. These thoughts are
  
responsible for maintaining anxiety and
  
depression.  They are often expectations
  
or assumptions about ourselves or others.
  
Intermediate beliefs are rules or guidelines that
  
we follow.
  

Examples:
 
“I should avoid meeting new people at all costs.”
  
“Danger is always present.”
 
“People will always take advantage of me.”
 

CORE BELIEFS 
Core beliefs are considered to be at the root, or deepest level, of our thinking.  These beliefs
  
represent our views of ourselves, others, and the world around us.  They have an absolute
  
quality to them.
 

Examples:
  
“I am unlovable.”
 
“All men are dangerous.”
 
“The world is completely dangerous.”

EXAMPLES: 
“I am unlovable.” 
“All men are dangerous.” 
“The world is completely dangerous.”

EMOTIONS
 
Emotions are one word that describes a feeling.  (See emotion worksheet, pg. 69) 

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY
  
THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS?
 

If it’s a full sentence, it’s a thought.  Feelings are one word and are expressions of emotions.

Nobody likes me Depressed 

I will never get better Hopeless 

I am comfortable with life Content

THOUGHT-STOPPING TECHNIQUES
 
Many people have experienced unwanted, intrusive, or obsessive thoughts that run through 
their mind. Sometimes individuals dwell on these thoughts for hours.  Unfortunately, these 
thoughts can cause strong and unpleasant emotional reactions, self-defeating or unhealthy 
behaviors, and uncomfortable physical reactions in the body. Thought-stopping is a strategy 
that may distract you, reducing, or stopping the unwanted thoughts from running rampant. 

I.	  First recognize negative thought process (excessive worrying, exaggerated fears,
  
rumination)
 

II.	  Interrupt the thought process by: 

a. Closing your eyes and shouting “STOP”                                              

b. Visualizing a stop sign 

c. Thinking of a pleasant memory 

d. Singing your favorite song 

e. Stopping and taking ten deep breaths 

f. Scheduling worry time (see page 60 for more information about this strategy)

THINKING TRAPS
 
When something happens, our mind comes up with a first interpretation.  Sometimes we don’t 
have all of the important information and our first interpretation is not completely accurate.  
Below are common thinking traps that can lead to inaccurate interpretations. 

1. Jumping to Conclusions or Fortune Telling 
° Overestimating the probability of negative outcomes, or predicting the future 

2. Thinking the Worst 
° Overestimating how bad the outcome will be 
° Assuming what is currently happening or is going to happen is the worst thing that could 

ever happen  

3. Using Feelings as Facts or Emotional Reasoning 
° Using your emotions as proof (e.g., I feel anxious so something bad is going to happen; I 

feel guilty so I must have done something wrong) 

4. Dichotomous Thinking or Black-and-white Thinking 
° Looking at situations in terms of extremes, everything is all good or all bad 

5. Mind Reading 
° When we believe we know what others are thinking and assume that they are thinking the 

worst of us with no evidence to support thought 

6. Over-generalization 
° Using words like always or never to describe situations or events 
° One negative event means everything is negative 

7. Catastrophizing 
° When we imagine the worst possible thing is about to happen and predict we won’t be 

able to cope with the outcome
 
° Expecting a disaster
   

8. Labeling 
° Seeing yourself as having only negative traits 

9. Discounting the positives  
° Underestimating the positive things you accomplish 

10. Personalizing  
° Taking blame for events that may have other contributing factors 

11. Blaming  
° Difficulty accepting responsibility for your own action, often blaming your problems on 

others

Thought Thinking Trap 

“She refused to do what I asked Jumping to conclusions – maybe something came 
her to do.” up at school and she had to stay late. 

“She obviously doesn’t respect me.” Mind reading – I do not know for certain that she 
doesn’t respect me.  I am assuming she doesn’t.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THOUGHTS AND 
CORE BELIEFS? 
Like a tree with many leaves, we have many 
thoughts. Our thoughts come and go and change 
with the seasons. The quality of our thoughts will 
depend on the quality of our core beliefs.  Core 
beliefs are like the roots of a tree.  Strong, healthy 
roots feed healthy leaves.  Unhealthy roots will 
feed unhealthy leaves.
